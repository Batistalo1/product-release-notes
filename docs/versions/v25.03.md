# Version 25.03
**October 2025 · API v31**

##  New Features

- New level of abstraction for Doors. One can now create a door without having a coupled device and preconfigure it. Once a device is assigned to the door, it will automatically receive its configuration. This allows for preparing the system before actually coupling the devices.
- Features listed per device also embed a flag to specify if the feature is enabled or not.
- Latest updated time for an OSS transponder is now saved in the credential and can be consulted via the API.
- When resetting a DOMController, a new parameter allows not resetting its IP configuration.
- Supports certificates with a full authority certification chain.

##  Fixes

- `GET api/all-events` request used to fail when both `from` and `what` parameters were used simultaneously.
- When a Tapkey lock ID is missing, a full reprogramming will now collect it back correctly.
- Schedules might be missing in ACM at coupling time — fixed.
