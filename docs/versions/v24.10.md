# Version 24.10
**October 2024 · API v28**

---

##  New Features

- Added an auto-coupling mode to the system, allowing automatic coupling of devices upon discovery.
- When allowing auto-coupling to "low" BLE quality, the coupling is not immediate but delayed by 5 minutes to ensure selecting the best parent.
- Migration from PHP 7 to PHP 8.
- Optional permissions, schedules and OSS doors can now be saved in a backup.
- Set-offline is now available even if the device is missing or syncing.

---

##  Fixes

- Full reprogramming is now directly applied on offline devices when triggered.
- Updating the name or description of an OSS door no longer triggers any synchronization.
- Fixed `/api/oss/config` route that could return an empty array instead of an empty object when no configuration was set.
