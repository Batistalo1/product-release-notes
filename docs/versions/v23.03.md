# Version 23.03
**March 2023**

---

##  New Features

- **OSS Updater — introducing dynamic validity groups.**
- New **Fast Online Synchronization** parameter in the global configuration. This reduces synchronization time of online devices from 15 min to 10 sec. *(Note: there could be an impact on battery lifetime depending on how optimized the Access Control Software implementation is.)*
- Separating OSS events read by OSS Updater into a second WebSocket.
- Changes on Week Schedules will now only impact the devices referring to that Week Schedule, not others.

---

##  Fixes

- Pushing `doorGroupIds` as `null` in an OSS door will correctly result in the door belonging to no DoorGroups.
- `DomDeviceIsThere` event is sent correctly again.
- Reduced the chance of having incorrect BLE quality information on a device.
