# Version 22.12
**December 2022**

---

##  New Features

- **Introducing the OSS Updater** — a new device managed by the DOMBridge, allowing updating of OSS transponders. Requires implementing the new `/api/oss` routes.
- Support for up to 4 templates instead of 2.

---

##  Fixes

- Online devices v1 are correctly managed again (update directly from a former version is now working).
- Improved online coupling experience.
- Significantly reduced the amount of data sent to devices (better performance and battery lifetime).
- Extended delay in OSS configuration is now correctly applied on the device.
- During a restore, an explicit error message is returned if the provided password is wrong.
- Manual DNS setup is fixed.

---

##  Known Issues

Online coupling can sometimes get stuck with a device staying in "coupling" state.

**Workaround:** Open RFNM settings, go to the **"route devices"** tab, then submit the configuration again.
