# Version 23.10
**October 2023**

##  New Features

- **Introducing OSS Creator.** The OSS Updater can now be set as "creator", allowing to create the OSS application data structure on a virgin Desfire transponder.
- **Introducing Wireless+.** Allows devices to report a transponder to the Access Control Server, which can then take the decision of granting access or not.
- Permissions can now be assigned to access groups, each group defining its own opening delay.
- Extended global configuration parameters.
- New route to push several OSS permissions at once.
- New OSS toggle mode: the transponder must be shown twice to switch to permanently open, instead of once.
