# Version 24.01
**January 2024**

---

##  New Features

- Configuration of OSS and coupling directly from the DOMService App.
- Configuration and permissions can now be pushed to new/coupling devices. When coupled, they will automatically apply these values.
- Slightly improved OSS Updater performances (using the Skip Access option also improves performance when used as an Updater only, not combined with Access Manager).
- Devices will no longer be synchronized if no value changes during an API call (better battery management).
- Filter of synchronized devices in the DOM Service app.

---

##  Fixes

- The mute buzzer parameter is correctly set on the OSS Updater at coupling.
- Global configuration values are correctly pushed during offline coupling.
- Using OSS Creator mode, if the transponder was not correctly written the first time, it will now be recovered automatically.
