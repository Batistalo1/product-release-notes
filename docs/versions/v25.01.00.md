- List all available features per device *(note: the device must be coupled to have the full list)*.

##  Fixes

- Toggle mode for OSS was reset to default when changing the configuration of an OSS door — fixed.
- The `limit` parameter in the route `/api/all-events` was not interpreted if no page was given.
- Decoupling an RFNM which has children devices now correctly returns a 400 Bad Request. A `force` parameter is added to override this protection.
- Passing `null` values for summer and winter dates in `/api/dombox/dstchanges` will no longer trigger a warning in the response body.
- Fixed an exception when calling `/api/dombox/user/{username}` with a user that has no permissions.
- Apple Wallet is no longer triggered when presenting an iPhone on a device.
- Returns the correct network configuration when using DHCP client on a DOMController Premium.
