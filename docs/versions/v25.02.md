##  New Features

- Officially supports the new **DOM Online Mesh** products (please contact us for more details).
- Week/day schedules can now be set per device instead of system-wide, allowing for more flexibility.
- OSS dynamic validity can now be set in terms of weeks, months or years.
- It is now possible to assign different key numbers when configuring OSS (out of the standard).
- Using the OSS Updater, the timeout for transponder read/write is now configurable.
- PackId configuration can be defined globally to the site (still possible to override it per door).
- DOMController can be updated through the API instead of SSH (though it is longer and only for fallback).

- Daylight Saving Time is now better managed when having more than 3 years of old dates.
- Mobile keys based on OSS model can now be used with no actual OSS configuration in the doors.
