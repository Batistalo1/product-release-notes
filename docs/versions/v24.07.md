##  New Features

- It is now possible to factory reset a controller.
- A new parameter has been added to ignore UID tags when OSS/EID is set.
- Office function can now be assigned to single permissions.
- The global performance of event collection has been improved.
- The ACM default display LED is now BLUE instead of red (ACM Firmware 5.9).

##  Fixes

- It is now impossible to remove a device from a RFNM using the route-devices API route.
- Devices will no longer be out-of-sync when a configuration change is sent but does not impact them directly.
- Some requests are no longer bound to device state. If a device state is not correct to pull a request, the request will be stored and pushed when the state is ready.
- The online configuration of RFNM/ACM is now up to date after changing IP settings.
- The stability of coupling using the DOMService app has been improved.

##  Known Issues
